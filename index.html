    <p>Hello, I am Genesis Vargas.My birthday is January 20, and I am 16 years old. My mom is Puerto Rican and my dad is Dominican, which makes me both. Also, I have 2 brothers and 1 sister, that are all older than I am. The High School I attend is KIPP NYC College Prep as a sophmore. </p>
    <li><a href="url">Interest</a></li>
    <p>I am interested in dance. In middle school I did dance all the 4 years for every show. Also, I am interested in the criminal justice field because I want to be a homicide detective. On the other hand, if I dont become a detective, I want to be a social worker for abused/mistreated children.    </p>
    <li><a href="url">Goals</a></li>  
    <p>In the future I will like to go to and graduate from Syracuse University in order to make my own money and maintain myself and my future family. Also, I will like to move to and live in Orlando, Florida after I graduate from college.    </p>
